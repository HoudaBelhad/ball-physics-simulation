# 🏀 Bouncing Ball Physics Simulation (Python)

This project is a simple 2D physics simulation of a bouncing ball using **Python and Pygame**.
The ball is affected by gravity, collides with the ground and walls, and gradually loses energy
on each bounce.

This project is designed for **learning basic physics simulation** and **game development concepts**.

## 🚀 Features

- Gravity-based vertical movement
- Horizontal motion
- Collision with ground and walls
- Energy loss on each bounce (restitution)
- Ground friction
- Smooth animation (~60 FPS)
